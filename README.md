Okay, first you need to build the linux kernel in order for you to configure it and build your own distro later on. <br />
Check ```LinuxBuild``` directory for an automated build. 


:warning: You don't have to clone nor install the hall kernel since you can automate the build. <br />

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KMx404/LinuxBuild.git 

$ cd LinuxBuild 

```
<i>Now, after cloning the repository. Lets install what's needed and Go on. </i>

```
